# FKNA LightHouse

Build an application using FireBase, Koa, Node &amp; The Angular will likely be a small portion of the project.

* The concept implementing the the FKNA stack will be a facility/management tool for determining how much money could saved switching
  to alternative lightbulbs, like LEDs, or other power utilities; such as solar panels, uninteruppeted power supplies(UPS), wind power, smart switches ect.

* Ideally the application will take in the current cost of electric utilities focusing on light sources and give a cost to value saved with the alternative sources.
  which would then output projected future savings and the the amount of revenue saved overtime vs the initial cost of the alternative lightbulbs or other utilities.

* I would like to use D3 library to give visual representation of the data in a way that is meaningful and can be dynamic as alternative sources are picked from, such as various kinds of lightbulbs and also various kinds of utlities i.e. the solar panels (can be small window cill ones).

* Amazon API for the prices of various utilities.
* Research for an API that will have information on the various utilities specifications i.e. the kilowatts per hour or how much electricity it can store in case of
  power outage.
* Possible third API?
